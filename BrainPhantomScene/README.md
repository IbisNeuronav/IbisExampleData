# BrainPhantomScene

This is a tutorial on how to register MR and US data using Ibis.
**US Volume Reconstruction with GPU** and **Rigid Resigtration with GPU** plugins are used for this purpose.

The directory consists of MR and US data of a brain phantom in MINC format. The two MINC files and the XML file form a scence together. Below video shows how to perform the registration on this data.
