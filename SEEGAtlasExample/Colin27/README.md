# Description

This example was based on Colin27 brain atlas.
The “posImplantation” image was generated by creating electrode trajectories and subtracting from Colin27. 

This is distributed as example data for the SEEGAtlas Plugin [1] for IBIS and is not intended to be a complete or accurate example.

Original Colin27 images can be found [2]: https://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/colin-27-average-brain/

CSF/GM/WM tissue classification was obtained from the high resolution Colin27 [3] https://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/colin-27-average-brain-2008/
